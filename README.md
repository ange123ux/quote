## QUOTE

### Description
In life there are a lot of quotes that we hear from one another, there are those that we read, and there are those that we create by ourselves even if they are not known to a wider audience. When someone receives a beautiful quote from their beloved ones, they feel happy. It is for this reason that you can be able to come up with your own quote or write the one that already exists and the page is going to update itself!
