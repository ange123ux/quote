## IMPOSING PIZZA

### Description
Imposing Pizza is coming as a solution to the health and weath of the customers. The best thing about it is that users are able to choose the type of the pizza they want, the size, as well as the toppings. Also, they are able to see the amount of money they are going to pay right after hitting order now button which is quite interesting.

I consider myself as someone who is lucky because I grew up in a family where I am the first person to take programming classes. Currently, I am a student in Southern New Hampshire University and I am doing Communications in Business. Having a Software Developer degree will be an added advantage to my career, and I can't wait to make that big step in my life.
